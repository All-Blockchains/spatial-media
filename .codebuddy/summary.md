# Project Summary: Spatial Media

## Overview of Technologies Used
The project is primarily developed using **Python** and utilizes various libraries and frameworks to handle spatial media. The key technologies include:

- **Flask**: A micro web framework for Python, used for building web applications.
- **Gunicorn**: A Python WSGI HTTP server for UNIX, used to serve the Flask application.
- **PyInstaller**: A tool for converting Python applications into stand-alone executables.

## Purpose of the Project
The Spatial Media project is a collection of specifications and tools designed to facilitate the use of 360Â° video and spatial audio. It provides metadata specifications for spatial audio and spherical video, as well as tools for injecting this metadata into media files. The project aims to enhance the experience of immersive media by enabling proper handling and playback of spatial audio and video formats.

## List of Build/Configuration/Project Files
- **Build/Configuration Files:**
  - `/setup.py`: Configuration for packaging the project.
  - `/docker/Dockerfile`: Docker configuration file for building the application container.
  - `/docker/requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required by the application.
